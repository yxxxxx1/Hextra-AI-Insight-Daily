## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost – I'm Launching a Community to Livestream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

**For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads down, completing three major open-source projects.** One of them, [AIClient2API ↗️](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts 1000+ Stars! The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** 🤯

**I didn't pay a single cent in API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen.** And renting servers? Nah, platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience totally hammered home one thing: **AI is amplifying our creativity, the creativity of ordinary people, in unprecedented ways.** ✨

**While the journey of solo development was incredibly fulfilling, it was also a bit lonely.** Those moments of stumbling, those nights when inspiration struck – I always wished I had fellow travelers to share and discuss with. 🫂

**So, an idea sparked: create a "Knowledge Planet" (a community platform) to gather all you restless, creative spirits.** 🚀

**This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community.** The price point is low – **50 RMB** – let's just say it's for a "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken feast, making friends, and establishing a pact for mutual growth. 🤝🍗

**What's in it for you if you join us?**

**I'm about to develop a personal prompt management tool from scratch.** The community will officially kick off when we hit 7 members, and inside the community, I'll be: 👇

*   **Daily Livestream-style Updates**: I'll record my development progress, thought process, and tech stack choices throughout the entire journey. 📹
*   **Sharing Real-life Pitfalls**: I'll unreservedly share problems encountered and bug-solving approaches, helping you dodge those detours. 🚧
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the reasoning behind it with you. 🤔

**You can totally watch a product come to life here, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality in our hands. ✨

**If you're also passionate about AI development, and curious to see how one person can "arm" themselves with free tools, then welcome aboard!** Let's build something awesome. 🥳
